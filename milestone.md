What needs to be done (besides moderation) before ModChat V2 can be up for beta.

1. Add support for multiple devices and tabs.
2. Make sure to only unvalidate tokens once they reach the client.
3. Refresh token theft detection.
4. Make sure the Tensorflow is up all the time or move it to Heroku.
5. Error handling.
